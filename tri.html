                <h2>MISSILE MAN OF INDIA</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (15 October 1931 - 27 July
                    2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
                    president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
                    Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                    engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
                    science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
                    Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
                    space programme and military missile development efforts.
                    
                    <br>
                    He thus
                    came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
                    development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
                    technology.
                    He also played a pivotal organisational,
                    technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
                    1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                <h2>About The Legend</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A.P.J. Abdul Kalam served as the <b> 11<sup>th</sup> President of India from 2002 to 2007.</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
                        1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of
                        the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles,
                        which helped earn him the nickname <b>“Missile Man.”</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Among those successes was Agni, India's first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which
                        incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kalam received <b>7</b> honorary doctorates from <b>40</b> universities. The Government of India
                        honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan in 1990</b> for
                        his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.
                    </li>
                    <li> In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution
                        to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India. In 2013, he was the
                        recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the
                        management and leadership of a space-related project".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
                        in August 2015.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant
                        species as<i> Drypetes kalamii </i>, in his honour.

                <h2>Death Reasons </h2>
                <p>  On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on
                    <u>"Creating a Livable Planet Earth" </u>at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. 
                    While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter
                    the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his
                    lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition;
                    upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.[87] Despite being placed in the
                    intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.
                    His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: <b>"Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</b>
